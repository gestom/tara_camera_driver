  - The buffer in ImuDriver seems a bit unstable. No mutex. Is it right?
    Can we use a dynamic structure instead? I'm still not quite sure
    how/why it works.
    It seems that xunit_lib_tara relies on this being a fixed array
    of data, because the ids are updated internally for some
    obscure reason.

  - Tara.h and Tara.cpp are only needed to load the camera device info.
    This should be a parameter of the node, and we should isolate the
    device id retrieval code if necessary.

  - variance values in tara_imu_driver.cpp are fantasy.
    We should get them from the datasheets of the LSM6DS0 chip.
